We are generally satisfied with how we approached this assignment as we did not run into any
issues that could not be resolved with looking at their documentation.  We started by adapting the
model and view components (along with their necessary subclasses) then  moved to the controller
component, but it might've been more efficient to start with the subclasses and then go into the
larger components so that we could determine all of their necessary functionality to work with the
components they interact with.

Our experience with the providers was short but very helpful, they gave us their initial code on
time and when we emailed them for missing interfaces or view implementation files, they responded
quickly.
